## ADIwg Overview and Goals

The *Alaska Data Integration Working Group* (ADIwg)[^1] was formed to examine and address the technical barriers to
efficiently integrate and share data within and among participating organizations.

ADIwg evolved from, and supports the common interests of, the [North Slope Science Initiative Oversight Group (NSSI)](http://www.northslope.org/),
[Alaska Ocean Observing System Board (AOOS)](http://www.aoos.org/), the [Arctic Research Mapping Application (ARMAP)](http://armap.org/),
[North Pacific Research Board (NPRB)](http://www.nprb.org/),
the [Alaska Climate Change Executive Roundtable (ACCER)](http://www.aoos.org/adiwg/accer/), and their member agencies.

## Mission Phases

From the outset, ADIwg divided its broad mission into three phases:
{: .withlist}

1. manage and exchange ‘project’ metadata
2. manage and exchange ‘data’ metadata
3. exchange data

### Phase 1: Project Metadata

The objective is to make exploring and coordinating **project metadata** across all participating organizations seamless through
the adoption of an interagency standard and protocol. Version 1 of the ADIwg Project Metadata Standard has been completed. However,
work is currently ongoing on Version 2. See the respective [Project][projects] pages for more information.

### Phase 2: Data Metadata

The objective is to make exploring and coordinating **data metadata** across all participating organizations seamless through
the adoption of an interagency standard and protocol. Work on Version 1 of the ADIwg Data Metadata Standard is currently on-going.
Additionally, as part of the mdTranslator project, ADIwg is developing an open source tool that transforms ADIwg metadata into various formats,
including standards based on [ISO 19139](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_metadata#ISO_19139_Geographic_information_Metadata_XML_schema_implementation).
See the respective [Project][projects] pages for more information.

### Phase 3: Data Exchange

The objective is to make exploring and exchanging **data** across all participating organizations seamless through
the adoption of an interagency standard and protocol. Work on this phase has not begun.
